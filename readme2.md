For those of us who want to increase our running fitness level, running on the track is a classic. A track is rubberized, flat, and comes in very specific sizes ie 400 meters. For my project I looked at runners' data from a 400 meter track to see how people's running fitness levels change over time. This project looks at whether having access to a 400 meter track in Kezar Stadium, San Francisco produces changes in a runners' fitness level.  

## What does a change in my 'running fitness level' look like?

The easiest way to think about this is to look at a distribution of your times. For example suppose you go out and run 6 laps on the track a few times a week. The first 50 laps you might complete your laps in 100 seconds each. But what about the next 100 laps? As you run more laps, your body adapts and gets more efficients, and then boom you're running those next 100 laps 10 seconds faster.

## How can we determine if we've improved?

In order to detect a change in our running fitness level,
